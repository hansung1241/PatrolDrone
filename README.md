A patrol drone can be utilized to enable efficient patrolling in areas that are difficult for humans to patrol, such as mountainous terrain or restricted zones.

To achieve this, the drone follows a predetermined route and detects any suspicious individuals during its patrol.

When a suspicious individual is identified, the drone tracks them while streaming their real-time location.

Additionally, the drone captures photos and saves them along the designated route. 

These stored photos are then uploaded to a website in real time, allowing administrators or relevant personnel to review them immediately.
